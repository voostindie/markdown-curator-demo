The **Markdown Curator Demo** is a demo application on top of the [[Markdown Curator]] framework that serves as a working example for a curator on a vault. The vault that this file is in, to be exact. It's like Inception.

## Timeline

<!--query:timeline-->
- **[[2024-07-24]]**:
    - I updated the code in this [[Markdown Curator Demo]] in accordance with the migration to [Dagger](https://dagger.dev) of the [[Markdown Curator]] core.
- **[[2023-03-08]]**:
    - Finished the [[Markdown Curator Demo]] that runs on top of this vault.
- **[[2023-03-03]]**:
    - I - [[Vincent OostindiÃ«]] - write my daily notes in an outline. I put this outline in the "Activities" section. Why do I do that? So that:
    	- The [[Markdown Curator Demo]] knows where to look for the outline of daily notes, and knows what to ignore.
