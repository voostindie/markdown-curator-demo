[Logseq](https://logseq.com) is a great tool that (re-)taught me the power of the daily log. I don't use it myself however, because:

- Its power is in the tool itself. It lists referenced notes, runs queries and does much more, but it's all dynamic. I prefer static, plaintext files that I can view and edit in any editor.
- Everything is an outline. But I also write articles, newsletters, e-mails and other prose in my notes. It's possible to do in [[Logseq]], but not to my liking. I want full freedom.
- It doesn't support folders. All notes (except the daily ones) are lumped together in a single folder. The [[Logseq]]-way is to use tags and other properties. I don't like that.
- I have thousands of existing notes. Importing them into [[Logseq]] is going to be massive undertaking. On top of that I have written scripts and tools on top of my notes. I'll need to replace those too.

That's why I use [[Obsidian]].
