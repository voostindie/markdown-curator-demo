[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is "a powerful and extensible knowledge base that works on top of your local folder of plain text files."

I've been using [[Obsidian]] since late 2020, and after 2+ years I say "amen" to the tagline. It works great for me!

I don't use [[Obsidian]] alone. I combine it with my own [[Markdown Curator]] tool.

## Recommended plugins

[[Obsidian]] has hundreds of plugins. Some people seem to install them all. Not me. I keep it to a minimum:

- **Calendar**: adds a calendar view, ideal for browsing daily notes.
- **macOS Keyboard Navigation**: enables macOS-specific keys.
- **Outliner**: work with lists like in Workflowy or RoamResearch.
- **Periodic Notes**: create/manage and your daily, weekly and monthly notes.
- **Quick Switcher++**: enhanced Quick Switcher.
- **Vimrc Support**: auto-loads a startup file with Vim commands.

Okay, I cheated. I use a few more. See the next section.

## Recommended theme, fonts and related plugins

The default [[Obsidian]] theme is okay, but not great, in my opinion. Instead I use the **Minimal** theme. 

As the text font I use **Proxima Nova**. and for monospace I use **JetBrains Mono**.

To further customize [[Obsidian]]'s look & feel I use 3 plugins:

- **Minimal Theme Settings**: controls the colors and fonts of the Minimal theme.
	- I use the **Things** color schemes. 
	- I disable the underlining of internal links.
- **Style Settings**: offers controls for adjusting theme, plugin and snippet CSS variables.
	- Here I change the font sizes of headings: level 1 to 180%, level 2 to 150% and level 3 to 120%.
- **Hider**: hide UI elements such as tooltips, statusbar, title and more.
	- I hide things like the app ribbon, the status bar, tooltips and instructions.

Here's what that looks likes (with the left sidebar open, while I typically have it closed)

## Recommended snippets

One last customization I have added to my [[Obsidian]] setup is a single CSS snippet:

```css
.cm-comment {
	font-size: 75%;
}
```

This decreases the size of the HTML comment tags. That is: the custom `<!--query-->` tags.
