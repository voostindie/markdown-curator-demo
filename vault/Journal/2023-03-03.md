## Activities

- I - [[Vincent Oostindië]] - write my daily notes in an outline. I put this outline in the "Activities" section. Why do I do that? So that:
	- I have a nice structure for my daily notes: activities, on the agenda, and sometimes other stuff.
	- The [[Markdown Curator Demo]] knows where to look for the outline of daily notes, and knows what to ignore.
- Started, finished and archived the [[Demo vault and accompanying curator]] project, for demoing purposes.
- Started writing [[The do's and don't of notekeeping]]. I'm keeping them all in the [[README]], for now. That's the first place people will look, I guess.
