## Timeline

<!--query:timeline-->
- **[[2023-03-03]]**:
    - I - [[Vincent OostindiÃ«]] - write my daily notes in an outline. I put this outline in the "Activities" section. Why do I do that? So that:
    	- I have a nice structure for my daily notes: activities, on the agenda, and sometimes other stuff.
    	- The [[Markdown Curator Demo]] knows where to look for the outline of daily notes, and knows what to ignore.
