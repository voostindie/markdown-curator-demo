## Context

Goal: set up a demo vault that I can use to demo how I keep my notes, and an accompanying curator application that runs on top of it.

I want this because I like to talk about my notekeeping skills and tools, but I can't show (and don't tell) any of it, because I only have "real" notes, and those can be private or sensitive.
