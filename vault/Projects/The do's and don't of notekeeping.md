## Context

As this is a demo vault that shows how I keep notes, it feels right to also document in this same vault the do's and don'ts that I follow.

Documenting the do's and don'ts is in itself a project. Every project has a note. You're looking at one right now.

On the daily log I mention when I'm working on a project, and what I did. Because of that for every project I can generate a timeline, showing its progress:

## Timeline

<!--query:timeline-->
- **[[2023-03-03]]**:
    - Started writing [[The do's and don't of notekeeping]]. I'm keeping them all in the [[README]], for now. That's the first place people will look, I guess.
